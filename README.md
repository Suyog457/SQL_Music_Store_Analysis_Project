This project is for beginners and will teach you how to analyze the music playlist database. You can examine the dataset with SQL and help the store understand its business growth by answering simple questions.

This project Also involves the analysis of a fictional music store's database using SQL. The goal is to derive insights about customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. The database includes tables for customers, invoices, invoice items, artists, albums, and tracks. Through various SQL queries, the project explores key metrics such as total revenue, top-selling albums and tracks, customer purchase patterns, and more. This analysis can help inform business decisions for the store by identifying popular genres, high-value customers, and potential areas for growth.

I recently completed a comprehensive data analysis project focused on a fictional music store's database using SQL. The project involved querying a relational database to extract, analyze, and visualize key business insights.

Key Highlights:

Database Management:-

Worked with complex SQL queries to manage and manipulate data across multiple tables, including customers, invoices, tracks, albums, and artists.

Conducted in-depth analysis to identify top-selling genres, most profitable artists, and high-performing sales regions.
Business Insights: -

Generated actionable insights by analyzing customer purchase patterns, sales trends, and inventory management to optimize the store's offerings and marketing strategies.
Reporting:-
Created detailed reports and visualizations to present findings, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
This project enhanced my SQL skills, particularly in areas like JOIN operations, subqueries, and aggregate functions. It also strengthened my ability to translate raw data into meaningful insights that can drive business growth.
